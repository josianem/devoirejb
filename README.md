**YOLOV5**

1. Explanation about the files in the ‘yolov5/important docs’ folder:
- Convert\_pascaltoyolo.ipynb: this script is to run on google colab, to convert the labels from pascal to yolo.
- Model Summary: contains all of the info, results, predictions of the model
- Best uae.pt: this is the best weights file for the model
- Best bhr.pt
- Replace.py: the script to run locally to changes words in the labels files if needed to
- training model using best.pt exp.docx: this is a documentation of some experiences conducted on the model
- hp tuning: to show the different experiences held to reach the optimal hyperparameters
- yolo-model-object-detection final notebook.ipynb: this is the notebook to run on Kaggle for faster results, to train the model and run inference.



1. How to use this model?

1) **Running the model**


Section 1

-open the notebook yolov5/important docs/ yolo-model-object-detection final notebook.ipynb

-if cloning from github, generate a key to add it next to the github link, since the key expires after 90 days, and the repo is private

-install all the requirements

-better to use Kaggle to implement it because it’s much faster






Section 2





-This section is to edit the data.yaml file, which we use to precise the number of classes and their names, whenever we need to add classes, we must edit this file and this section in the code is dedicated to edit it

\- here is an example of the data.yaml file, next to train and test we find their paths

NB: also we should edit the file yolov5/models/yolov5s.yaml and change the parameter nc, if we added new classes




`	`Section 3

-this is the part where we train the model, next to --cfg we choose which version of yolov5 we want to use, here we implemented yolov5s which is the small one, since the dataset is small

\- next to --weights, we leave it empty ‘ ‘ like this, if we are building the model from scratch, 

If we want to build over another model, we must put the best.pt file in here

-once we run this code, we will see this message, we must choose option 2 by writing it in the console

-this cell must be run twice for the changes to take effect

-Results will start to appear as shown below

- box\_loss: location loss based on IoU
- cls\_loss: classification loss based on binary cross-entropy for each class
- obj\_loss: objectness loss based on how confident there is an object in each bounding box
- P: Precision
- R: Recall
- mAP: mean Average Precision 

NB: To finetune to model, we can modify the hyperparameters by editing  data/hyps/hyp.scratch-low.yaml

At the end of the training, it will show where the results are saved and we will use this later on

- choose the confidence threshold for the predictions
- choose the weights generated by the previous cell
- we can display the images with the predictions

-Save the best weights and download them

-finally, we can now load the model from any notebook and run predictions

\- if we want to build over this model, we put the best.pt next to – weights

-We can also freeze 10 layers for example and then add the parameter –freeze when training



**YOLOV7**

1. Explanation about the files in the ‘yolov7/important docs’ folder:
- Convert\_pascaltoyolo.ipynb: this script is to run on google colab, to convert the labels from pascal to yolo.
- Model summary yolov7\_uae: contains all of the info, results, predictions of the model
- best uae.pt: this is the best weights file for the model
- best bhr.pt
- best uae+bahrein
- replace.py: the script to run locally to changes words in the labels files if needed to
- yolo-obj-det-v7-uae: notebook to run on Kaggle to train the model and run inference.
- yolo-obj-det-v7-uae: notebook to run on Kaggle to train the model and run inference.

**NB:** 

**There are 2 files showcasing the difference between yolov5 and yolov7 tested on the datasets of Bahrein and uae, and we can find them in the main repo.**
